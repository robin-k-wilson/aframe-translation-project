# Simple translation project (work in progress)

This app uses A-Frame, Google Poly, and Google Translate for translations.

## How to use!

Click on different objects in the scene and you'll get a translation pop up in the upper left corner.

*Pssst! Look around!* I promise you'll find something surprising!

## Planned Expansions

- Added voice that reads translations
- Latin transliteration translation for Chinese (pinyin) and Japanese characters
- VR mode has translation word pop ups
- Toggle sentences with context vs one word object vocabulary
